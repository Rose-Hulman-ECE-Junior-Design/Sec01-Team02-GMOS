# ðŸš— Autonomous Vehicle Learning Platform ðŸš—

Welcome to the **ECE362 Autonomous Vehicle Project**! This repository supports a hands-on educational experience where high school students learn real electrical and computer engineering (ECE) concepts through an engaging autonomous vehicle competition.

---

## Project Objective

Redesign the autonomous vehicle to *make ECE concepts visible and engaging*. Students wonâ€™t just race carsâ€”theyâ€™ll explore software-hardware interactions, power efficiency, feedback control, and wireless communication.

## âš¡ Core Electrical Concepts

| Concept   | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Voltage (V)** | Electrical potential difference |
| **Current (I)** | Flow of electric charge |
| **Resistance (Î©)** | Opposition to current |
| **Power (P)** | Energy per unit time: `P = V Ã— I` |
| **Energy (J)** | Total work: `E = P Ã— t` |

These are observed and logged live during races!

## ðŸ”— Series vs. Parallel Circuits

### In Series

- Components are connected end-to-end.
- **Same current** flows through all components.
- **Voltages split** across components.

\[
R_{\text{total}} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + \dots
\]

### In Parallel

- Components are connected across the same voltage source.
- **Same voltage** across each branch.
- **Currents split** through each branch.

\[
\frac{1}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \dots
\]

## âš¡ EDLC Supercapacitors

**EDLC (Electric Double-Layer Capacitors)** are used instead of traditional batteries.

### Why Use Them?

- Ultra-fast charging (minutes vs. hours)
- High power density
- Excellent for high-drain, short-duration tasks

### Design Considerations

- Must avoid **reverse polarity**
- Use **voltage balancing** for series configurations
- Charging profiles must prevent **overvoltage**

### Use Case in Project:

- Vehicle charges via **Qi wireless charging** or 12V wired input
- Students observe voltage rise and energy transfer in real-time

## PID Control

**PID = Proportional + Integral + Derivative** controller.

Used to maintain stable autonomous driving performance.

### Why PID?

- Smooth, precise line-following behavior
- Reduces oscillations and over-corrections

### Tunable Parameters:

- `Kp` â€“ Proportional (reacts to error)
- `Ki` â€“ Integral (accumulates past error)
- `Kd` â€“ Derivative (predicts future error)

### Example Formula:

```c
error = desired_position - actual_position;
correction = Kp*error + Ki*integral + Kd*derivative;
